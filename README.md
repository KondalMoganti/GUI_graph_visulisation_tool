# GUI_graph_visulisation_tool

This project facilitates graph plotting from CSV files. To use it, save the following three files in the same folder as your CSV file:

    CardioFitness.py: Execute this script to open the GUI. Navigate to the file menu, select the Excel file to upload, and choose the desired graphs from the menu to plot.

The current version supports a single CSV file located in the folder. However, it can be extended to handle multiple CSV files, allowing for the plotting of diverse graphs. Consider exploring the code for potential developments.
