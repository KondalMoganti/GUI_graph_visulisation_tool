# GUI_graph_visulisation_tool

This project helps to plot the graphs from the csv files.

There are 3 files which you need to save in the same folder with csv file 

CardioFitness.py has to be run to open GUI and from the file menu choose excel file to upload and choose the graphs from the menu to plot it.

At the moment this file is only for one csv which is present in the folder but this can be developed further to take any csv files to plot different kind of graphs.
